C is a general purpose programming language that was created in the 1970s by Dennis 
Ritchie. It's used for a variety of applications, including system administration, 
network programming, and embedded software. C is known for being easy to learn and read, 
which makes debugging code faster and easier. However, C lacks some features that 
are common in other programming languages, such as object-oriented programming, 
exception handling, and garbage collection.
